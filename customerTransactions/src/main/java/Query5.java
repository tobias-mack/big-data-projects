/**
 * Assume we want to design an analytics task on the data as follows:
 * <p>
 * 1) The Age attribute is divided into six groups, which are [10, 20), [20, 30), [30, 40), [40, 50),
 * [50, 60), and [60, 70]. The bracket “[“ means the lower bound of a range is included, whereas “)”
 * means the upper bound of a range is excluded.
 * <p>
 * 2) Within each of the above age ranges, further division is performed based on the “Gender”,
 * i.e., each of the 6 age groups is further divided into two groups.
 * <p>
 * 3) For each group, we need to report the following info:
 * Age Range, Gender, MinTransTotal, MaxTransTotal, AvgTransTotal
